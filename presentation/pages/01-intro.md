# **Metaframeworks**

<ul class="mb-10">
  <li v-click>🧑‍💻 You're likely already using one <devicon-nextjs /> <devicon-nuxtjs /> <devicon-remix /> <devicon-astro /> <devicon-svelte /> ... </li>
  <li v-click>🧙 They offer great DX and performance, but they feel like magic, don't they?</li>
  <li v-click>🧑‍🔧 Let's de-magic them... by building one!</li>
</ul>

<h2 v-click> Why am I even doing this? </h2>

<ul>
  <li v-click>I do a lot of integration work at <strong>SuperTokens</strong></li>
  <li v-click>I saw a lot of commonalities between metaframeworks</li>
  <li v-click>...but no single definition</li>
  <li v-click>So I set on a journey to find one 🚀</li>
  <li v-click>Plus, it's fun! 😄</li>
</ul>

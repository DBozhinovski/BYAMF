# Patches: **Recap**

- Vite + Vinxi + React + Wouter = Metaframework!

- Should you use it? **No.** ⚠️
- Can you make your own? **Yes, and you should.**

## What About?

- RSCs - **Vinxi has a plugin.**
- Angular/Solid/Vue/Svelte/... instead? **Absolutely! This can work with any of them.**

<div class="highlight" v-click>Don't just accept something as magic; understand how it works.</div>

    border-radius: 5px;
    margin-top: 20px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 60px;
  }
</style>

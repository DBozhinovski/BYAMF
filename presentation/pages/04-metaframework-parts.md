# **Metaframeworks** - the parts that make them

### ‚ùó The parts that they share matter.

Most metaframeworks out there have:

<ul>
  <li v-click>A <strong>router</strong> (or routers)</li>
  <li v-click>A way to <strong>render on the server</strong></li>
  <li v-click>A way to <strong>call functions on the server</strong>*</li>
  <li v-click>A client-side <strong>UI library/framework</strong> (that can integrate with the SSR)</li>
</ul>
